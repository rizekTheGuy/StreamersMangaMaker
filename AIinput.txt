[narrator] (the friends ludwig and Jerma sat on the bench)

[Ludwig] (hey let's talk about stuff)

[narrator] (Jerma was confused but then he said)

[JermaCursed] (What do we talk about)

use the enter
and make it very long
and make it as fucked up and funny and edgy as posible

Jerma is weird
DougDoug is a Pepper that makes programing stuff with twitch chat and sucks at 2D platformers
Jschlatt likes men and guns and money and hate liberals
